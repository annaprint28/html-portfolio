<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a thoughtful and determined young girl pursuing a degree in Information Science and Engineering. Born in April 28th 2006, I am already charting my path in a challenging field while also exploring where my true interests lie, such as web development. Even though my academic journey sometimes feels overwhelming—especially when marks don’t meet my expectations,I care deeply about learning and improving myself.</p>

<p>Beyond academics, I have a warm, caring nature that shows in how I communicate with family and friends. Whether I am inviting someone to join a celebration or seeking the right words to say, I try to be considerate and genuine. I appreciate clear, honest advice over empty praise, and I am closest to the people I love.</p>

<p>My curiosity extends far beyond textbooks. I am interested in practical skills like understanding how cars works or how to present myself professionally as well as small details that make daily life smoother.My ultimate dream is to make my parents proud and keep them happy as well as travel the world around with family and friends.I are learning to balance self-acceptance and ambition. I have a bright spirit and a mind that wants to grow, and step by step, I am shaping my own unique story.</p>
